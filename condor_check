Notes:
   * Pledges are 50% of the last pledge entered in SiteDB for the site. Tier-1 pledges are set to zero for
     analysis, even though analysis jobs can run at the Tier-1 sites.
   * Usage statistics are from the last three months in Dashboard for analysis only.
      * Usage numbers from Wisconsin in March are overinflated in the Dashboard before April 2014 so only the
        past two weeks is used.
   * The Site Table does not include DAG jobs (from CRAB3) which do not run at a DESIRED_Site, but rather on the 
     schedd.
   * Sites are only listed in the Site Table if there is demand (running or queued) or pledged resources.
